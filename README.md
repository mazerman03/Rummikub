# ♟️ Rummikub Optimization & Agent Simulation

This project explores the strategic depths of the game **Rummikub** using **Pure Integer Programming (IP)**. It includes a mathematical model that finds the optimal plays during a Rummikub match, alongside various agents (greedy, random, solver-based) to simulate competitive gameplay.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- ✅ Model Rummikub moves using Integer Programming
- ✅ Maximize tile usage per turn (or minimize remaining tiles)
- ✅ Develop agents with different strategies
- ✅ Simulate games and compare agent performance
- ✅ Explore joker handling and complex combinations

---

## 🧠 How it Works

### Game Representation
- Each **tile** has a color and a number (1–13)
- Tiles are used to form **runs** (same color, consecutive numbers) or **groups** (same number, different colors)
- The goal is to **empty your hand** before others do
