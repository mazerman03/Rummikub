Rummikub is a popular tile-based game that involves both combinatorial optimization and strategic decision-making. This paper presents a formal investigation into the game mechanics, identifies the core computational challenges, and introduces an integer programming (IP) model designed to find optimal moves for a given player state. We analyze the problem space, define constraints based on legal game rules, and propose an IP formulation to maximize score per turn. Computational experiments validate the modelâ€™s effectiveness and provide insights into its potential for AI agent development.

\section{Introduction}
Rummikub is a classic tile-laying game blending elements of rummy and mahjong. Its complexity arises from its dynamic board, flexible tile arrangements, and constraint-based rules. While humans rely on heuristics, we aim to explore a formal mathematical model that can generate optimal plays automatically.

\subsection{Motivation}
Understanding the strategic depth of Rummikub can aid in creating intelligent agents for game-playing and provide case studies in integer programming applications.

\section{Background and Related Work}
\subsection{Rummikub Game Rules Overview}
Each player starts with 14 tiles. The goal is to create valid sets (groups or runs) to reduce one's hand to zero. A group is three or four tiles of the same number in different colors. A run is three or more consecutive numbers of the same color.

\subsection{Computational Complexity}
Previous research suggests that determining a valid move is NP-hard due to the permutations and combinations of tile arrangements.~\cite{rummikub_complexity}.


\subsection{Related AI Models}
Discuss existing models or papers on game AI, such as those used in Sudoku, Scrabble, or other combinatorial games.

\section{Integer Programming Model}
\subsection{Problem Definition}
Given a hand of tiles and the current board state, determine the optimal move (or series of moves) that maximizes score.

\subsection{Model Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item All tiles and their colors are encoded numerically.
    \item The board is flattened to a list of valid sets.
    \item Initial meld rules and joker rules are incorporated.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Variables and Parameters}
Let $x_{ijk}$ be a binary variable indicating if tile $i$ is used in group/run $j$ in position $k$.

Define:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $T$: set of all tiles
    \item $G$: set of possible groups/runs
    \item $B$: board state
    \item $H$: hand tiles
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each tile used only once per turn
    \item Groups/runs must follow valid Rummikub rules
    \item At least 30 points for the initial meld (if first move)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Objective Function}
\[
\max \sum_{i \in H} \sum_{j \in G} \sum_{k} v_i \cdot x_{ijk}
\]
where $v_i$ is the value of tile $i$ (equal to its number).

\section{Implementation and Experiments}
\subsection{Tools Used}
Model implemented using Python and solved with Google OR-Tools / Gurobi / CPLEX.

\subsection{Test Cases}
Present example game states and corresponding optimal plays derived from the model.

\subsection{Results}
Show performance in terms of solution time, move quality, and comparison with heuristic approaches.

\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Model scalability as board complexity increases
    \item Handling dynamic player interaction
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Integration with other AI agents.
    \item Use of reinforcement learning or hybrid approaches.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
We have proposed an integer programming model capable of identifying optimal Rummikub moves from a static game state. This framework serves as a step toward developing intelligent agents capable of playing competitively.
